# kview

A web interface for viewing Deno KV stores.

## Usage

See [docs](./docs/index.md) for information on how to use `kview`, roadmap, and known limitations; which is also
integrated into the webapp.

## Installation

A current version of the Deno CLI is required to install and host `kview`. To install, run the following command:

```
deno run -A -r https://kview.deno.dev/install
```

You will be prompted for a location to install `kview`.

Once the installation is complete, change to the installation directory and run the following to start the `kview`
server:

```
deno task start
```

You can also upgrade your installation to the latest version by performing:

```
deno task upgrade
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you do not have an upgrade task in your configuration, your installation pre-dates the capability being added and
> you should instead re-install the application which will then include the upgrade task.

> [!TIP]
> The [kitsonk/kview](https://github.com/kitsonk/kview) repository can also be cloned, though this will effectively be a
> development environment for kview, versus a standalone web application.
